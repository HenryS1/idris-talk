#+TITLE:  Verified state machines
#+AUTHOR: Henry Steere

* Behaviour can be encoded in types and checked at compile time!

  - State machine transitions which have pre and post conditions can have 
    those conditions encoded in dependent types

  - The compiler can then check that sequences of state transitions which are not
    allowed cannot be executed by using the type checker

* Active area of research 

  - Edwin Brady, Idris's creator is researching how to implement verified network protocols 
    and resource and state aware systems by encoding state in types

* Example 

  Flight plan

  - Airplanes must have fuel in order to fly 

  - Fuel must be greater than or equal to the required fuel for a trip

  - After two flights an airplane must be scheduled for a safety inspection before it can 
    fly again
