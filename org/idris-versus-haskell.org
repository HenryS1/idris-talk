#+TITLE:  Idris vs Haskell
#+AUTHOR: Henry Steere

* Haskell has dependent types

  But not Haskell 98. You need to enable a miscellany of GHC extensions to get 
  dependent typing in Haskell

* Idris has totality checking

  Haskell doesn't support this currently

* Idris has smart optimisations

  Idris converts Nats to Ints at compile time to prevent inefficiency. Haskell
  doesn't currently have this capability.

  Idris optimises away proof code which is only required at compile time. 
  Apparently there are plans for something similar in Haskell. I'm not sure whether this
  is in place yet.
