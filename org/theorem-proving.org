* Integral to Idris

  Idris has built in theorem proving which can allow it to verify properties about
  your programs using dependent types

  - Verify input to functions using types

  - Verify totality of functions

  - Verify behaviours using types
  
* Proof arguments

  Sometimes Idris can't figure out the properties you want to establish by itself
  and requires extra arguments to establish them

  - Proof arguments serve as guarantees that required conditions are met and 
    can provide assistance to Idris or may be required for a proof to be possible at all

  - Proof arguments can be passed implicitly to avoid clutter

* Rewriting 

  Rewriting uses an equality based proof that shows the equivalence of types to convert an
  expression of one type into an expression of another type
